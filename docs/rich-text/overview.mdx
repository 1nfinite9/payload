Payload provides a rich text editor adapter pattern that allows you to use any rich text editor you want. Out of the box, Payload comes with two rich text editors, [Lexical](./lexical) and [Slate](./slate) but you can also install your own.

  **As of 2.0.0**, Lexical is now the recommended rich text editor for new projects. Slate is still supported for legacy projects, but we are moving to Lexical from here on out which offers more features. For new projects as of 2.0.0, we recommend using Lexical. For existing projects, use Slate.

## Installation

To define a rich text editor to be used across your entire project, you can pass it into the `editor` property in your `payload.config.ts` file. This will install the rich text editor for all fields that use the `richText` type. You can also pass in any options that the rich text editor accepts, which will be used by default for all instances of the rich text editor.

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'
import { lexicalEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'

export default buildConfig({
  editor: LexicalEditor({
    // pass in your options here
  }),

  // the rest of your config
})
```

### Override at the field level

You can customize the rich text editor on a field-by-field basis by passing in an editor to the `editor` property on the field. This will override the rich text editor configuration that is installed at the top level.

```ts
import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'
import { LexicalEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'

export Example: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'example',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'body',
      type: 'richText',
      editor: LexicalEditor({
        // pass in your field-specific options here
      }),
    },
  ],
}
```

  **Note:** It is **not recommended** to use more than one rich text editor in your project. This will result in multiple rich text editors being loaded on the page, which will slow down your CMS and increase the bundle size of your project.
