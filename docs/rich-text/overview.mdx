From version 2.0, Payload introduced a flexible way to handle rich text editing. Instead of a built-in, one-size-fits-all approach, Payload now uses the adapter pattern. This means you get to choose which rich text editor you want and simply plug it in.

## Choosing your Editor

By design, Payload doesn't come pre-packaged with a rich text editor. This is great because it keeps the core lightweight and you only add what you truly need. At present, Payload officially supports two rich text editors:

- Lexical (@payloadcms/richtext-lexical): This is the recommended editor for new projects starting from version 2.0. It's feature-rich and geared for modern requirements. **It's currently in beta** and will receive most support, as well as featuere updates.

- Slate (@payloadcms/richtext-slate): Ideal for legacy projects. If you've been using Slate before the 2.0 update, you can continue to do so. This editor will not receive and feature updates anymore.

## Configuring Your Editor

To integrate your chosen editor, first install its package, then pass it into the Payload configuration.

For instance, if you want to use Lexical:

```ts
import { lexicalEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'

const config: Config = {
  editor: lexicalEditor({
    // lexicalEditor configuration options go here
  }),
}
```

or Slate:

```ts
import { slateEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-slate'

const config: Config = {
  editor: slateEditor({
    // slateEditor configuration options go here
  }),
}
```

This makes the chosen editor the default for all your rich text fields.

## Overriding Editor Configuration for a Field

Sometimes, you might need a specific configuration for a particular rich text field. You can override the default setting by specifying the editor property directly within the field:

```ts
{
  name: 'richTextField',
  type: 'richText',
  editor: lexicalEditor(), // This will override the default editor property set in the payload config.
},
```

However, it's generally advisable to stick to one editor for consistency and performance. Including multiple editors can bloat your project and slow down page loads.

Both `lexicalEditor` and `slateEditor` functions can accept configuration objects to tailor the editor's behavior. Refer to their individual documentation for details on available settings.

Payload's flexibility in handling rich text editing ensures your project remains lightweight and customizable. Whether you're starting a new project or continuing with a legacy one, Payload has got you covered.
