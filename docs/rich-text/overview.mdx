Since 2.0, Payload can support multiple rich text editors through the adapter pattern - similar to how database and bundler adapters work.

This means that, by default, payload does not come installed with a rich text editor. Instead, you can install the one you want to use, and pass it to the config.

Currently, there are two officially supported rich text editors: @payloadcms/richtext-slate and @payloadcms/richtext-lexical. Here's how you can pass it into the config:

```js
import { lexicalEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'
// import { slateEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-slate'

const config: Config = {
    editor: lexicalEditor({}),
    // editor: slateEditor({}),
}
````

This sets the default editor for all rich text fields, unless the rich text field has an `editor` property. This will override the Ã¨ditor` property set in the payload config:



```js
{
  name: 'richTextField',
  type: 'richText',
  editor: lexicalEditor(),
},
```

The respective lexicalEditor or slateEditor functions accept an object which you can use to configure the editor. Those editor-specific are explained in their respective documentation pages.


TODO:

- Talk about how Payload supports two rich text editors, and they work on an "adapter" pattern, which means you need to install the one you want to use separately and pass it to config
- Talk about how Slate is still supported for legacy projects, but we are moving to Lexical from here on out which offers more features
- For new projects as of 2.0, use Lexical
- For existing projects, use Slate
- Probably move some of the more complex docs from Fields -> Rich Text over to this set of docs
- Show how you can install an editor at the top level, or override on a field-by-field basis (not recommended, no reason to have 2 editors installed. Lots of JS loaded)
