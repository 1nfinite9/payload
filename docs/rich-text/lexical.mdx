The new Lexical Rich Text Editor an incredibly powerful, extensible rich text editor created by Meta. It is the recommended rich text editor for new projects as of Payload 2.0.0. It is also the default rich text editor for new projects created with the [Payload CLI](/docs/cli).

Lexical is a great choice for projects that need a rich text editor that is easy to use, but also extensible and customizable.

## Installation

To define Lexical as your rich text editor, you can pass it into the `editor` property in your `payload.config.ts` file. This will install Lexical for all fields that use the `richText` type. You can also pass in any options that Lexical accepts, which will be used by default for all instances of the rich text editor.

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'
import { LexicalEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'

export default buildConfig({
  editor: LexicalEditor({
    // pass in your options here
  }),

  // the rest of your config
})
```

### Override at the field level

You can customize Lexical on a field-by-field basis by passing in an editor to the `editor` property on the field. This will override the rich text editor configuration that is installed at the top level.

```ts
import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'
import { LexicalEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'

export Example: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'example',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'body',
      type: 'richText',
      editor: LexicalEditor({
        // pass in your field-specific options here
      }),
    },
  ],
}
```

## Configuration

You can pass in the following options to configure Lexical:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `features` | Features are the entry point for adding functionality into the rich text editor. [More](#features) |
| `blocks` | Pass in an array of [Blocks](/docs/fields/blocks) that can be added inline inside the editor. |
| `lexical` | An object of Lexical-specific options for changing the editor settings like theming. |

### Features

Lexical is built on a "feature" system that allows you to add functionality to the editor. This is done by passing in a `features` array to the `LexicalEditor` function. Each feature is an object with a `name` and `options` property. The `name` property is the name of the feature, and the `options` property is an object of options that will be passed into the feature.

```ts
LexicalEditor({
  features: [],
})
```
### Blocks

Talk about blocks

### Example

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'
import { LexicalEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'
import { CtaBlock } from './blocks/CtaBlock'
import { FormBlock } from './blocks/FormBlock'

export default buildConfig({
  editor: LexicalEditor({
    features: [
      'h1',
      'h2',
      'h3',
      'paragraph',
      'link',
      'bold',
      'italic',
      'underline',
      // ...
    ],
    blocks: [
      CtaBlock,
      FormBlock,
    ],
  }),

  // the rest of your config

})
```
