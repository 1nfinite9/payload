One of Payload's goals is to build the best rich text editor experience that we possibly can. We want to combine the beauty and polish of the Medium editing experience with the strength and features of the Notion editor - all in one place.

Classically, we've used SlateJS to work toward this goal, but building custom elements into Slate has proven to be more difficult than we'd like, and we've been keeping our options open.

<Banner type="warning">
  Payload's Lexical rich text editor is currently in beta. It's stable enough to use as you build on Payload, so if you're up for helping us fine-tune it, you should use it. But if you're looking for stability, use Slate instead.

Lexical is extremely impressive and trivializes a lot of the hard parts of building new elements into a rich text editor. It has a few distinct advantages over Slate, including the following:

1. A "/" menu, which allows editors to easily add new elements while never leaving their keyboard
1. A "hover" toolbar that pops up if you select text
1. It supports Payload blocks natively, directly within your rich text editor
1. Custom elements, called "features", are much easier to build in Lexical vs. Slate

To use the Lexical editor, first you need to install it:

```
npm install @payloadcms/richtext-lexical
```

Once you have it installed, you can pass it to your top-level Payload config as follows:

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'
import { lexicalEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'

export default buildConfig({
  collections: [
    // your collections here
  ],
  // Pass the Lexical editor to the root config
  editor: lexicalEditor({})
})
```

You can also override Lexical settings on a field-by-field basis as follows:

```ts
import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'
import {
  lexicalEditor
} from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'

export const Pages: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'pages',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'content',
      type: 'richText',
      // Pass the Lexical editor here and override base settings as necessary
      editor: lexicalEditor({})
    }
  ]
}
```

## Extending the lexical editor with Features

Lexical is built to be extended. It's easy to add new features to the editor, and it's easy to override or remove existing features. Simply pass in a features prop inside of lexicalEditor({}). Here's an example:

```ts
import {
  BlocksFeature,
  LinkFeature,
  UploadFeature,
  lexicalEditor
} from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'
import { Banner } from '../blocks/Banner'
import { CallToAction } from '../blocks/CallToAction'

{
  editor: lexicalEditor({
    features: ({ defaultFeatures }) => [
      ...defaultFeatures,
      LinkFeature({
        // Example showing how to customize the built-in fields
        // of the Link feature
        fields: [
          {
            name: 'rel',
            label: 'Rel Attribute',
            type: 'select',
            hasMany: true,
            options: ['noopener', 'noreferrer', 'nofollow'],
            admin: {
              description:
                'The rel attribute defines the relationship between a linked resource and the current document. This is a custom link field.',
            },
          },
        ],
      }),
      UploadFeature({
        collections: {
          uploads: {
            // Example showing how to customize the built-in fields
            // of the Upload feature
            fields: [
              {
                name: 'caption',
                type: 'richText',
                editor: lexicalEditor(),
              },
            ],
          },
        },
      }),
      // This is incredibly powerful. You can re-use your Payload blocks
      // directly in the Lexical editor as follows:
      BlocksFeature({
        blocks: [
          Banner,
          CallToAction,
        ],
      }),
    ]
  })
}
```

## Generating HTML

The lexical editor saves content in JSON format. However, if you wish to generate HTML, you have two main methods:

1. Generate HTML in the Collection: Add a sibling field in your collection. This field will derive HTML from the JSON content saved. As this makes payload generate and output the HTML, you can directly utilize it in your frontend.
2. Generate HTML in the Frontend: You can convert the JSON to HTML directly within your frontend.

The editor comes with built-in HTML serializers, simplifying the process of converting JSON to HTML.

### Outputting HTML in the Collection:

To add HTML generation directly within the collection, follow the example below:

```ts
import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'

import {
  HTMLConverterFeature,
  lexicalEditor,
  lexicalHTML
} from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'

const Pages: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'pages',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'nameOfYourRichTextField',
      type: 'richText',
      editor: lexicalEditor({
        features: ({ defaultFeatures }) => [
          ...defaultFeatures,
          // The HTMLConverter Feature is the feature which manages the HTML serializers. If you do not pass any arguments to it, it will use the default serializers.
          HTMLConverterFeature({}),
        ],
      }),
    },
    lexicalHTML('nameOfYourRichTextField', { name: 'nameOfYourRichTextField_html' }),
  ],
}
```

lexicalHTML() creates a new field in your collection, which automatically converts the referenced lexical richText field into HTML through an afterRead hook.

### Generating HTML in the Frontend:
If you prefer converting the JSON to HTML on the frontend, here's a snippet to guide you:

```ts
import type { SerializedEditorState } from 'lexical'
import {
  convertLexicalToHTML,
  defaultHTMLConverters
} from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'

async function lexicalToHTML(editorData: SerializedEditorState){
  await convertLexicalToHTML({
    converters: defaultHTMLConverters,
    data: editorData,
  })
}
```

In this method, we utilize the `convertLexicalToHTML` which is included in `@payloadcms/richtext-lexical` which takes in the serialized editor state and converts it to HTML.

## Coming Soon

Lots more documentation will be coming soon, which will show in detail how to create your own custom features within Lexical.

For now, take a look at the TypeScript interfaces and let us know if you need a hand. Much more will be coming from the Payload team on this topic soon.
