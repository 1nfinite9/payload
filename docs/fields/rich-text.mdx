  The Rich Text field is a powerful way to allow editors to write dynamic content. The content is
  saved as JSON in the database and can be converted into any format, including HTML, that you need.

  <strong>Tip:</strong>
  <br />
  Collections are automatically allowed to be selected within the Rich Text relationship and upload
  elements by default. If you want to disable a collection from being able to be referenced in Rich
  Text fields, set the collection admin options of <strong>enableRichTextLink</strong> and{' '}
  <strong>enableRichTextRelationship</strong> to false.
</Banner>

Relationship and Upload elements are populated dynamically into your Rich Text field' content. Within the REST and Local APIs, any present RichText `relationship` or `upload` elements will respect the `depth` option that you pass, and will be populated accordingly. In GraphQL, each `richText` field accepts an argument of `depth` for you to utilize.

### Example

`collections/ExampleCollection.ts`

```ts
import { lexicalEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical';
import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types';

export const Pages: CollectionConfig = {
	slug: 'pages',
	fields: [
		{
			name: 'content',
			type: 'richText',
			editor: lexicalEditor({
        features: ['h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5', 'h6', 'bold', 'italic', 'underline', 'strikethrough', 'link', 'blockquote', 'ul', 'ol', 'code'],
      }),
		},
	],
};

```
